# **CouchDB Rules Engine Development Roadmap**

## **Overview**

This document outlines the development roadmap for evolving the CouchDB Rules Engine prototype into a production-ready solution. The roadmap is structured in achievable phases, with each phase building upon the previous one while delivering immediate value.

## **Current State Analysis**

**What Exists Now**:

* CouchDB prototype using validation functions as rules engine
* Basic validation rules (householdIncome, interviewComplete, householdSize, numberOfDependents)
* Single test file with npm test integration
* Docker-based CouchDB setup via setup.sh
* Sample valid/invalid application data

**Core Architecture**:

* CouchDB design documents containing JavaScript validation functions
* Built-in CouchDB document versioning (via `_rev` field)
* REST API interaction with CouchDB
* Validation rules execute on document insert/update

**Current Limitations**:

* Only reports first validation error
* Rules execute in unspecified order
* Limited rule metadata and documentation
* Single monolithic test file
* No web-based rule management interface
* No advanced rule types (scoring, graduated eligibility)

---

## **Phase 1: Foundation & Testing Infrastructure**

**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks **Priority**: High - Essential foundation work

### **Objectives**

* Establish robust testing framework
* Create basic web interface for rule management
* Enhance rule metadata structure
* Improve error handling

### **Technical Tasks**

#### **1.1 Testing Infrastructure Reorganization**

**Task**: Restructure tests into modular, discoverable files

```
test/
├── unit/
│   └── validators/
│       ├── householdIncome.test.js
│       ├── interviewComplete.test.js
│       ├── householdSize.test.js
│       └── numberOfDependents.test.js
├── integration/
│   ├── couchdb-connection.test.js
│   └── rule-execution.test.js
├── helpers/
│   ├── couchdb-helper.js
│   ├── mock-data-generator.js
│   └── test-setup.js
└── fixtures/
    ├── sample-documents/
    └── expected-results/
```

**Implementation Notes**:

* Each validation rule gets its own test file
* Use glob pattern `test/**/*.test.js` for auto-discovery
* Create test helper utilities for CouchDB setup/teardown
* Add package.json scripts for targeted test execution

#### **1.2 Enhanced Rule Metadata Structure**

**Task**: Extend design documents with structured metadata

```json
{
  "_id": "_design/ruleName",
  "_rev": "auto-managed-by-couchdb",
  "rule_metadata": {
    "name": "Human-readable rule name",
    "description": "Detailed description of rule purpose",
    "version": "semantic-version",
    "author": "rule-author",
    "tags": ["category", "keywords"],
    "status": "active|draft|inactive",
    "created_date": "ISO-date",
    "modified_date": "ISO-date",
    "change_notes": "Description of last change"
  },
  "validate_doc_update": function(newDoc, oldDoc, userCtx) {
    // validation logic
  }
}
```


#### **1.3 Basic Web Interface (CRUD Operations)**

**Task**: Create minimal vanilla JavaScript web interface

**File Structure**:

```
web/
├── index.html (single-page application)

└── js/
    ├── app.js (main application)
    ├── components/
    │   ├── RuleList.js
    │   ├── RuleEditor.js
    │   └── TestPanel.js
    └── utils/
        ├── couchdb-client.js
        └── helpers.js

## **Implementation Guidelines**

### **Technology Constraints**

* **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript only (no frameworks)
* **Styling**: CSS with custom properties for theming
* **Backend**: Direct CouchDB integration (no middleware initially)
* **Testing**: Mocha with modular test files
* **Documentation**: Markdown for all documentation

### **Code Organization Principles**

1. **Modular Architecture**: Each component should be self-contained
2. **Minimal Dependencies**: Avoid unnecessary external libraries
3. **Customizable UI**: Use CSS custom properties for easy theming
4. **Test-Driven**: Every feature should have corresponding tests
5. **Documentation-First**: Document APIs and workflows before implementation

### **Risk Mitigation**

**Technical Risks**:

* CouchDB validation function limitations → Research and prototype early
* Performance at scale → Benchmark and optimize incrementally
* Security concerns → Implement security measures in Phase 3

**Project Risks**:

* Scope creep → Stick to phase deliverables
* Complexity growth → Maintain simplicity principles
* Integration challenges → Test integration points early

### **Success Metrics**

**Phase 1 Success**:

* All tests pass with new structure
* Web interface displays and manages rules
* Enhanced metadata is fully implemented

**Overall Project Success**:

* Production-ready rule management system
* Scalable testing infrastructure
* Comprehensive documentation
* Maintainable, minimal codebase

## **Next Steps**

1. **Start with Phase 1**: Focus on testing infrastructure and basic web interface
2. **Validate Approach**: Test CouchDB limitations and capabilities early
3. **Iterate Quickly**: Complete each phase before moving to next
4. **Document Everything**: Maintain documentation as code evolves
5. **Test Continuously**: Use test-driven development throughout

This roadmap provides a clear path from the current prototype to a production-ready rules engine while maintaining the innovative use of CouchDB's native capabilities.
