## **Implementation Guidelines**

### **Technology Constraints**

* **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript only (no frameworks)
* **Styling**: CSS with custom properties for theming
* **Backend**: Direct CouchDB integration (no middleware initially)
* **Testing**: Mocha with modular test files
* **Documentation**: Markdown for all documentation

### **Code Organization Principles**

1. **Modular Architecture**: Each component should be self-contained
2. **Minimal Dependencies**: Avoid unnecessary external libraries
3. **Customizable UI**: Use CSS custom properties for easy theming
4. **Test-Driven**: Every feature should have corresponding tests
5. **Documentation-First**: Document APIs and workflows before implementation

### **Risk Mitigation**

**Technical Risks**:

* CouchDB validation function limitations → Research and prototype early
* Performance at scale → Benchmark and optimize incrementally
* Security concerns → Implement security measures in Phase 3

**Project Risks**:

* Scope creep → Stick to phase deliverables
* Complexity growth → Maintain simplicity principles
* Integration challenges → Test integration points early

### **Success Metrics**

**Phase 1 Success**:

* All tests pass with new structure
* Web interface displays and manages rules
* Enhanced metadata is fully implemented

**Overall Project Success**:

* Production-ready rule management system
* Scalable testing infrastructure
* Comprehensive documentation
* Maintainable, minimal codebase

## **Next Steps**

1. **Start with Phase 1**: Focus on testing infrastructure and basic web interface
2. **Validate Approach**: Test CouchDB limitations and capabilities early
3. **Iterate Quickly**: Complete each phase before moving to next
4. **Document Everything**: Maintain documentation as code evolves
5. **Test Continuously**: Use test-driven development throughout

This roadmap provides a clear path from the current prototype to a production-ready rules engine while maintaining the innovative use of CouchDB's native capabilities.
